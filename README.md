# RasaDocker
A RASA NLU and RASA core tutorial project including docker containers for a more robust production type deployment.

This repository is just at it's infancy as I just began a blog tutorial at the end of February 2018 to teach people these methods.  If you are interested in following the tutorial, I will be posting tutorial blog posts, beginning March 1, 2018.

If you would like to follow along, take a look at my site: [Smith Strategy](www.smithstrategy.com)
